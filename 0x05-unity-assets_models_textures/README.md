For the next few projects, weâ€™ll be building a simple 3D platformer game. We encourage you to create development builds as you work and play test your game frequently.

The final product after the next few projects will function like this: Platformer - Final

At the end of this Models and Textures project, we will be at this stage in development: Platformer WIP - Assets: Models and Textures
